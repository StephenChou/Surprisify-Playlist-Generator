# Surprisify-Playlist-Generator
Playlist generator using Spotify API

Surprisify is a Spotify playlist generator that uses Spotify API and the Spotipy library. It first asks for user
authentication through Spotify, and then prompts the user to enter a "level". Levels correspond with how obscure the
playlist will be, using recursion to dive into the user's top artists' related artists.
